    </h1>
    <p>Biryani is a mixed rice dish with its origins among the Muslims of the Indian subcontinent. It is made with
        Indian spices, rice, and usually some type of meat (chicken, beef, goat, lamb, prawn, or fish), or in some
        cases, without any meat (vegetarian), and sometimes, in certain varieties, eggs and/or vegetables such as
        potatoes.</p>
